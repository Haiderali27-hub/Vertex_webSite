## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the website. No server is required as this is a static HTML/CSS/JS website.

## Custom Cursor

The website features a custom cursor that changes appearance when hovering over interactive elements. The cursor consists of two parts:
- A small dot that follows the mouse cursor precisely
- A larger circle that follows the main cursor with a slight delay

When hovering over interactive elements like buttons or cards, the cursor will change its appearance to indicate that the element is clickable.

## Browser Compatibility

The website is compatible with all modern browsers including:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

For the best experience, use the latest version of these browsers.

## Mobile Support

On touch-enabled devices, the custom cursor is automatically disabled, and the native cursor/touch functionality is used instead.
